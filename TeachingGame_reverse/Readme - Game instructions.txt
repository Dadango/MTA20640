Your objective is to get the car to the finish line. Hitting buildings, roadblocks or stopping too early will reset your car so you can try again, so try to follow the road and make it all the way with the gas you have. You will be awarded a score at the end of the level depending on the amount of gas you used.

The bar on the bottom of your screen shows your gas. You have a maximum of 300 gas to complete a level. Methods that make the car drive cost 20 gas, but the cost can be reduced by using methods inside for-loops (10 gas reduction) and if-statements (5 gas reduction).

Methods, for-loops and if-statements blocks can be selected using the dropdown menus.

When selecting a block, it will follow your cursor and if you click on a slot in the console (which is located on the right, the grey ellipses are the slots) it will be submitted. Your total gas will update automatically. If the block doesnâ€™t seem to snap into the slot, try to move it around a bit before placing it - it is unfortunately a little buggy depending on your screen resolution.

Loops and if-statements create indented slots. These slots can then hold other code blocks.

Dragging a method/if-statement/loop to the trash can allows you to delete it from the screen. The yellow button resets the level. The green button runs your code from the console.
